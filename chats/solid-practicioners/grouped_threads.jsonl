Not only how to manage their personal information but also how this information is shared with others. At the core, we focus on data sovereignty, standardisation, interoperability, and empowering users in data ownership.\n\nCurrently in the conceptual phase, we're building a tool for personal data management that integrates data across various technical platforms. Our primary objectives are:\n\n- **Facilitating Personal Data Management**: Creating a unified interface for user data control.\n- **Enhancing Data Interoperability**: Ensuring seamless data flow across platforms, adhering to SOLID principles.\n- **Promoting User Ownership**: Giving users full control over their digital identities.\n\nIn our research, we've engaged with pivotal SOLID repositories like [Soukai Solid](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid), [Solid Data Modules](https://github.com/solid-contrib/data-modules?tab=readme-ov-file), and [solid-contrib/solid-takeout-import](https://github.com/solid-contrib/solid-takeout-import).\n\nWe seek guidance on:\n\n1. **Tool and Technology Adaptation**: Advice on tools and technologies for transitioning to design and implementation.\n2. **Collaboration with Projects**: Opportunities to contribute to projects aligned with our vision.\n3. **Ontology and Standards**: Insights on using standards like vCard and FOAF for our data model.\n\nAs newcomers, we're keen to integrate into the community. We've joined the SOLID forum and Gitter channel and would appreciate guidance on other key forums and their formats.\n\nWe look forward to contributing to and collaborating within the SOLID community.

The final binaries are very small, (7-15 MB).\n\nIt is powered by [Manas](https://github.com/manomayam/manas) for storage abstraction, and Tauri for ui. Can use all sorts of tauri plugins and ecosystem.\n\nCurrently SolidOs is packaged, and [binaries](https://github.com/manomayam/solvent/releases/tag/solvent-v0.0.0) are shipped. Request you all to try and provide feedback.\n\nI believe, once the project become stable, this could make Solid an attractive storage api to code web & native apps with single code base.

Tell us about\nthe people your project is helping, has helped, or will help; and how.\n\nThe ESPRESSO team is developing a novel experimental framework to solve the critical problem in Solid's decentralized private web environment, which is this: **how do you search between Solid pods, when access to the resources in those pods depends on widely varying access rights?**\n\nThe advent of effective search engines was an inflection point in the public’s adoption of the World Wide Web. More recently, the disadvantages of the centralized paradigm in Web search are becoming more and more apparent, as previously popular search engines return poorer-quality or even erroneous results, and providers of alternative search engines aiming to provide better-quality results face difficulties in scaling\ntheir offerings to return results of sufficient quality and relevance.\n\nPrivacy of search has been a priority\nfor alternative search engine providers for some years; and more recently, creators have been calling for more respect for their intellectual property rights in order to protect their work from being incorporated into AI (artificial intelligence) training data.\n\n**ESPRESSO** is the first project to take on access rights as a first-class component of decentralized\nsearch. We will open the session by demonstrating ESPRESSO's approach to a realistic scenario of\nmedical research over patient records in Solid pods.\n\nDuring the session, IR practitioners will present their innovative solutions, and by the end, IR\npractitioners working in Solid, FAIR, Linked Data, and adjacent fields will know how their work relates to\nothers.\n\n**Organizers:** \n\nHelen Oliver, Birkbeck, University of London, [h.oliver@bbk.ac.uk](mailto:h.oliver@bbk.ac.uk); \n\nMohammad Bahrani,\nUniversity of Southampton, [m.bahrani@soton.ac.uk](mailto:m.bahrani@soton.ac.uk)"}, {"event_id": "$1o-heKMUHPI-qbYGNmRBDd9KpLsn0ZbnHb905-VqaTE", "sender": "@h_oliver:matrix.org", "timestamp": "2025-01-14T22:19:15.473000", "body": "In addition, if any of you are interested in speaking at the ESPRESSO workshop, do please email me at [h.oliver@bbk.ac.uk](mailto:h.oliver@bbk.ac.uk) by 16 January!"}, {"event_id": "$rtlDDDaBVb-m1CtDMBgvrg9dh4CKFTz3YsAOs4Oxhj4", "sender": "@josh-cornejo:matrix.org", "timestamp": "2025-01-15T09:07:49.723000", "body": "\"how do you search between Solid pods, when access to the resources in those pods depends on widely varying access rights?\" ... is there a link to this framework?"}, {"event_id": "$2B3qKmNHAuGkiob8Up-vIK5YE_kdwnRCne7J2tUjzQ0", "sender": "@josh-cornejo:matrix.org", "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:20:32.331000", "body": "Found it ... https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381464447_Decentralized_Search_over_Personal_Online_Datastores_Architecture_and_Performance_Evaluation"}, {"event_id": "$DK3vgNltzxC7R-JIakEA5Frwxy_ZGmBlMiXH9PmOy5o", "sender": "@gibsonf1-5bf4b2ced73408ce4faf9d3d:gitter.im", "timestamp": "2025-01-15T15:35:46.938000", "body": "We think the answer to this is a standardized solid spec for a /search api on the server"}], "message_count": 6}

After reading most of the documentation (which then negates all the effort of using a copilot), the issue was that there was a type discrepancy between two subqueries ... which the co-pilots still \"can't see\". \n\nRegarding larger code generation, I am skeptical about security. In a post a few months ago I raised the \"A & B & C\" type attack, where the code generated is innocuous if you have 1 or 2 out of the 3 parts, but when combined it is a security breach.

Currently, it is based on a set of Solid CG drafts, some providing alternatives to one another, and various work happening outside of the CG, which is also part of the broader Solid Ecosystem. The first cornerstone of solid will be the W3C LWS spec, which will be finalized in the best case a year from now. I would expect that the WG charter may need to be extended, and it may take even longer.    Meanwhile, implementation feedback is fundamental, so if people are in a position to aim for the long run and have the capacity to adjust to inevitable changes, then I would say try to help with making Solid happen.

There are a number of apps which are either in production or are in beta or MVP phase.  It is perfectly feasable to make useful apps in the current state of affairs.  Will those apps need to be revised as the specs come into place, yes proabably.  But that does not meant that they can not perform the functions they were intended  for or be useful to people. This room and group are for people who are building those apps.  Please restrict your nay-saying to the specification channel which is what your critique applies to.  Yes, there are hurdles and things will change but that does not mean that nothing works or that users should be discouraged (as you are attempting to do).  I find it very counter-productive to meet new users with the kind of negativity you are displaying.

Practitioners tries to be bottom up - we start with a social issue or end-user need and work from there to practical ways those can be solved with Solid or other technologies.  Your top-down  approach - here's a technology/architecture question, how do we solve it is quite appropriate for the CG but unless one of our member projects is running into issues that they want addressed related to it, our discussions are focused on practice not theory, on things that exist or are being built today and can be used today to accomplish what our members are seeking to accomplish.  The Practitioners is meant to support people building products and services, not to discuss theories of how security should be handled which is much more appropriate for the CG.  If those topics come up in relation to a Practitioner project we'll certainly pass questions and suggestions to the CG, but I personally don't feel it is appropriate for the CG to raise those issues rather letting Practitioners decide for themselves what topics they want to discuss."}], "message_count": 7}
