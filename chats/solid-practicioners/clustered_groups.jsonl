The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement.

We got founding from nlNet earlier and plan to apply again soon. With that we should probably establish some \"salaries\" or hourly-rate for contributing and then gradually transition from external founding to community support to cover the operations. If we bring enough value for the community, it will collectively strive to cover our needs so that we keep providing the value. From WS financial reports the community has enough capacity to cover our needs with a surplus \/ pay us decent market rates (which are way above my needs). \n(I did not discuss it with michal\/mrkvon very extensively yet)"},{"event_id":"$ltzQ2lmLNhzRNR72I0R2swtcgPF4_zHKyN6c4LGDi8I","sender":"@elf-pavlik-53f689c8163965c9bc1ffb15:gitter.im","timestamp":"2023-11-14T16:20:10.546000","body":"I don't have anything specific in mind.

This chatroom is a good place to bring up general topics, but if we want agreement amongst the group, that has to happen on github where there is a record or what and why we decided.  In general my comment on strategies is that our business is supporting existing projects and to try to develop a strategy for the adoption of Solid is *way* beyond our resources.

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group.

But what's the fix?\", and I thought, \"Well, a decentralized protocol that let people build interoperable apps for sharing videos would be a huge step in the right direction.\"\nAnd I realized that I have an experience like this every day, if not multiple times a day, where I'll either see a headline, or hear something on the radio or on a podcast, and think, \"Solid would fix that.\" \nAnother example: I've heard Cory Doctorow interviewed on several podcasts lately, and on one hand, I'm like, \"Yes, exactly!\" to all of the problems of platforms that he points out, but on the other hand, I'm like, \"How is this guy not talking about Solid?!\" It's like someone ranting about the woes of spoiled milk, and never mentioning pasteurization.\nAnyway...here's why I bring it up: one of my longer-term hopes for the [Getting Started](https:\/\/solid-contrib.github.io\/getting-started\/) site ( [repo here](https:\/\/github.com\/solid-contrib\/getting-started\/) ) is to create a blog, or video channel, or something like that, to post frequent content (or links to externally created content) on one theme: \"Here's how Solid will fix that.\"\nAnd I want to mention it here, because: 1) I'm not sure when I'll be able to get to it, and 2) I think it might be a task that would benefit from several contributors working together--some people have more expertise, and others are better at explaining things, and others at delivering messages in an inspiring way. \n\nI suppose, rather than just lament that the thing doesn't exist, I should say, if anyone agrees with me, then perhaps we could discuss this as part of the Solid Practitioners group (at a mtg, or here, or in the forum?), or maybe we could try to form a separate group--I'm not an expert on getting things done in groups.

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

If what you meant is paginating triples from a single document, there is no way to do it. If you are able to decide the structure of the documents, you should write data in separated documents instead. For example, for a chat you could have one document per day instead of a document per conversation."},{"event_id":"$kdpBWNrI4f2nr6Xcc9kd-JmJUN3HaHXTlxZ520w7Jgs","sender":"@gibsonf1-5bf4b2ced73408ce4faf9d3d:gitter.im","timestamp":"2023-11-30T15:43:30.103000","body":"We plan to support pagination soon using the Apache Solr standard kv approach with start=int  and rows=int   where rows is the number of results you want back, and start is the row number you want to start from   https:\/\/graphmetrix.com\/trinpod"},{"event_id":"$w08sLmJKMfB7TgNgtMQx7Z5sgmZZ1ar2_69JMF1urVI","sender":"@timbot1789:matrix.org","timestamp":"2023-11-30T19:51:11.335000","body":"Very interesting.

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

The webId may contain a nickname for yourself. It need not be your real name, it can be a pseudonym.\n\nHowever, for the data we share with civic services, we need to get the person's legal name (otherwise the civic group may not be able to provide services).

They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster.

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

A good way to go about it is to have a main scribe but one or two people supporting, filling in missed stuff, and so on. Taking turns is great because it does end up being the case that the same people end up scribing, see scribes charts here for some data on who are the usual scribes in CG meetings :) generally it is the same 2-3 people. https:\/\/virginiabalseiro.github.io\/solid-ecosystem-monitor\/"}],"message_count":5,"embed_text":"Discussion on Improving Meeting Note-Taking and Scribing Equity: Participants

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Not only how to manage their personal information but also how this information is shared with others. At the core, we focus on data sovereignty, standardisation, interoperability, and empowering users in data ownership.\n\nCurrently in the conceptual phase, we're building a tool for personal data management that integrates data across various technical platforms. Our primary objectives are:\n\n- **Facilitating Personal Data Management**: Creating a unified interface for user data control.\n- **Enhancing Data Interoperability**: Ensuring seamless data flow across platforms, adhering to SOLID principles.\n- **Promoting User Ownership**: Giving users full control over their digital identities.\n\nIn our research, we've engaged with pivotal SOLID repositories like [Soukai Solid](https:\/\/github.com\/NoelDeMartin\/soukai-solid), [Solid Data Modules](https:\/\/github.com\/solid-contrib\/data-modules?tab=readme-ov-file), and [solid-contrib\/solid-takeout-import](https:\/\/github.com\/solid-contrib\/solid-takeout-import).\n\nWe seek guidance on:\n\n1. **Tool and Technology Adaptation**: Advice on tools and technologies for transitioning to design and implementation.\n2. **Collaboration with Projects**: Opportunities to contribute to projects aligned with our vision.\n3. **Ontology and Standards**: Insights on using standards like vCard and FOAF for our data model.\n\nAs newcomers, we're keen to integrate into the community. We've joined the SOLID forum and Gitter channel and would appreciate guidance on other key forums and their formats.\n\nWe look forward to contributing to and collaborating within the SOLID community. Your insights will be invaluable in shaping our project.\n\nThank you for the warm welcome.\n\nBest regards!"},{"event_id":"$aSjh37Hnhozi0M37s1HK-XrFsS8odgpQMcwEFhw-Qlg","sender":"@pegomez:gitter.im","timestamp":"2024-01-24T16:35:08.965000","body":"The thing is that for building that proof of concept, we have some doubts related with solid servers and custom ontologies, among other technical stuff.\n\nWe have seen that there are several approaches to the solid server (NSS, CSS, ESS, use.id, Trinpod, etc.). Which one better fits our needs for building a PoC? It would be useful at the beginning just implementing a simple flow:\n\nWrite to a pod\nRead from a pod\nAuthenticate a user\nWhich programming language is more supported to develop the whole functional app within the PoC?\n\nWhen it comes to trying to standardise the way individuals represent their personal career information, we have seen that there exist some ontologies like vcard, foaf or doac. What is the process of enriching those ontologies with our own proposal? At which point in development do you think it may have more importance?

It's installed through node, so easy to send out to dev workstations. It's a no-frills server that seeks only to implement the solid standard, so if you write your code against that, it should (theoretically) work against most of the other servers you listed. It can also be extended with modules, so you can experiment with a nonstandard feature if you feel so inclined."},{"event_id":"$OXpvLvfMrDZA4UU2-lAOCEyPJJMmEP67XF64sz1KjMU","sender":"@timbot1789:matrix.org","timestamp":"2024-01-24T18:22:19.827000","body":"Javascript definitely has the best support for solid apps.

They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem.

An announcement about [Solvent](https:\/\/github.com\/manomayam\/solvent).\n\nSolvent lets us use Solid apps in native context over filesystem. We can create pod views over  folders, configure root uri for them to be simulated, and run packaged apps over them.\n\nIt will thus enable us to code apps against solid storage api with web ui stack, and ship them as native apps against user's file system. The final binaries are very small, (7-15 MB).\n\nIt is powered by [Manas](https:\/\/github.com\/manomayam\/manas) for storage abstraction, and Tauri for ui. Can use all sorts of tauri plugins and ecosystem.\n\nCurrently SolidOs is packaged, and [binaries](https:\/\/github.com\/manomayam\/solvent\/releases\/tag\/solvent-v0.0.0) are shipped. Request you all to try and provide feedback.\n\nI believe, once the project become stable, this could make Solid an attractive storage api to code web & native apps with single code base. With proper support it can be extended to offer sync solutions, native-first apps, etc in future.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f"}],"message_count":1,"embed_text":"Announcement of Solvent: Native Solid Apps over

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

and Governance of the Solid Ecosystem Catalog with RDF and SHACL Shapes","llm_validation_notes":"The conversation cluster exhibits strong semantic coherence. All groups are related to the creation, maintenance, and governance of the Solid Ecosystem Catalog. They specifically discuss using RDF descriptions and SHACL shapes for data representation and validation, as well as the practical aspects of repository structure, versioning, and community collaboration. The progression moves from initial introduction and collaboration on shapes to repository restructuring, updates, and governance. I don't see any reason to split the groups into separate clusters as they all contribute to a unified narrative around the development of a key component of the Solid ecosystem."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Even if we can use the demoed indexes vocabulary to replace some part of the current TI, I would say that we still need a TI spec to keep a dedicated simple cross-domain data discovery mechanism. Then we can perhaps write a separated spec to define a \"standard\" way to index things for vertical use.\n\nYes, \" spec next to the type-indexes spec.\" sounds right."},{"event_id":"$PRna1CU-W4QmeDMzlKT8Xf0hN_VrSfbqjhVTmWo6OQo","sender":"@timbl-54d26c98db8155e6700f7312:gitter.im","timestamp":"2024-02-29T09:46:24.463000","body":"Agreed, ` solid:forClass schema:Photo; solid:instance <\/link\/to\/a\/Photo\/index>.` sounds wrong, `solid:forClass schema:PhotoLibrary; solid:instance <\/link\/to\/a\/Photos\/index#this>.` sounds better.

The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement.

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Intention is for sleepy.bike (which is single-page web app written with React) to work with different Pod providers - currently works ok with NSS and CSS. The webhookChannel-dependent implementation of email notification service works well with CSS, but not with NSS. The solid-notification-independent version works fine at least with NSS and CSS.\n\nBoth of the mentioned email notification services are dedicated servers written with koa and typescript. They use Solid-OIDC for authentication. I think i wrote some details in both repositories' README, if you want to read more.

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

I have most experience in Java\/JVM ecosystem and distributed systems, that I kind of specialised in. Never did web development or JavaScript, but had an exposure to a variety of different programming languages and decentralised software architectures. I liked algos and data structures most, and things related to programming languages themselves. I am dyslexic so I am kind of naturally attracted to any topics related to code readability, different programming paradigms, syntax expressiveness etc.\n\nSo I guess technically it's probably not too specialised, but I would most like to find some very high-level vision resources that will spark my heart and something very narrow that I can start with to focus on. Might be some small code contributions, but it is hard for me to motivate myself to work in JS, for too many reasons."},{"event_id":"$2m4KRvpi8wERtPUN--0amIOk4Xwm6W3Z9DW9A3BLbGI","sender":"@ewingson:matrix.org","timestamp":"2024-04-30T09:40:30.375000","body":"concerning the language, my writing english is better than my spoken english ;-) I have no extensive programming experience but am a strong fan of patterns of all kind.

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

and Governance of the Solid Ecosystem Catalog with RDF and SHACL Shapes","llm_validation_notes":"The conversation cluster exhibits strong semantic coherence. All groups are related to the creation, maintenance, and governance of the Solid Ecosystem Catalog. They specifically discuss using RDF descriptions and SHACL shapes for data representation and validation, as well as the practical aspects of repository structure, versioning, and community collaboration. The progression moves from initial introduction and collaboration on shapes to repository restructuring, updates, and governance. I don't see any reason to split the groups into separate clusters as they all contribute to a unified narrative around the development of a key component of the Solid ecosystem."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

All groups are related to the creation, maintenance, and governance of the Solid Ecosystem Catalog. They specifically discuss using RDF descriptions and SHACL shapes for data representation and validation, as well as the practical aspects of repository structure, versioning, and community collaboration. The progression moves from initial introduction and collaboration on shapes to repository restructuring, updates, and governance. I don't see any reason to split the groups into separate clusters as they all contribute to a unified narrative around the development of a key component of the Solid ecosystem."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

(New to Solid)\n\nI wanted to reach out and ask for advice to overcome a hurdle that is leaving me scratching my head. I am currently making attempts to deploy the NSS and seems like it does and does not work at the same time. I attempted to follow the documentation on Github and set up a reverse proxy using Nginx and link the server through the proxy_pass. The first issue I ran into was my SSL certificate did not like that the Solid server  domain name \"localhost\". I have since corrected that issue and now a face new problem. When I attempt to go to the domain that is attributed to the server my request times out, but if I curl the URL I get the index.html page. When I attempt to curl anywhere else besides the \"\/\" for the domain I am hit with a 401 on the server side. I since figured out how to register a profile thinking that would let me at least gain access. However, even though I set up an account, I still am unable to access the server from a browser. Not sure what do here.  All advice is welcomed. \n\nThank you."},{"event_id":"$wYjzyu2sUJ9--o0cMzdvUY0n8V4JJalClQZ1HuqY8Ks","sender":"@jeswr-5f532665d73408ce4fee1daf:gitter.im","timestamp":"2024-12-16T11:45:38.701000","body":"Hi v3x4s I would first note that self-hosting is not a requirement to use Solid. If you want to sign up for a Pod on a server that is already deployed then you can use https:\/\/solidcommunity.net or any other already hosted instance listed in https:\/\/solidproject.org\/for-developers.\n\nIf you do want to self-host, I would recommend going for the newer CommunitySolidServer (https:\/\/communitysolidserver.github.io\/CommunitySolidServer\/latest\/) rather than the NodeSolidServer\n\nCan I ask what are you looking to do with Solid - build apps, use apps, test things out?

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement.

There is no cap on uploads, due to Object Storage being quite affordable. \n\n1. All videos are transcoded into HLS, which optimizes for streaming on PeerTube's video player. \n\n2. I use an Object Storage layer separate from a self-hosted server. Linode has regular scheduled backups, last I checked they are daily. \n\n3. I have run the instance for almost two years now?

Broadly speaking, we encode whatever the original format is, plus a lower 360p resolution. So, let's say that you upload 50GB worth of video, you'd have that plus the smaller resolution version that gets generated.

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Tell us about\nthe people your project is helping, has helped, or will help; and how.\n\nThe ESPRESSO team is developing a novel experimental framework to solve the critical problem in Solid's decentralized private web environment, which is this: **how do you search between Solid pods, when access to the resources in those pods depends on widely varying access rights?**\n\nThe advent of effective search engines was an inflection point in the public\u2019s adoption of the World Wide Web. More recently, the disadvantages of the centralized paradigm in Web search are becoming more and more apparent, as previously popular search engines return poorer-quality or even erroneous results, and providers of alternative search engines aiming to provide better-quality results face difficulties in scaling\ntheir offerings to return results of sufficient quality and relevance.\n\nPrivacy of search has been a priority\nfor alternative search engine providers for some years; and more recently, creators have been calling for more respect for their intellectual property rights in order to protect their work from being incorporated into AI (artificial intelligence) training data.\n\n**ESPRESSO** is the first project to take on access rights as a first-class component of decentralized\nsearch. We will open the session by demonstrating ESPRESSO's approach to a realistic scenario of\nmedical research over patient records in Solid pods.\n\nDuring the session, IR practitioners will present their innovative solutions, and by the end, IR\npractitioners working in Solid, FAIR, Linked Data, and adjacent fields will know how their work relates to\nothers.\n\n**Organizers:** \n\nHelen Oliver,

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement.

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Applications: Development & Troubleshooting","llm_coherence_score":9,"llm_topic_label":"Solid Ecosystem Development and Application","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are strongly semantically related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster.

A couple of weeks ago I spent 7 days debugging some CYPHER query that the copilots generated - and it worked well on the CLI as parts (that's how it was built) but consistently failed when joined together. After reading most of the documentation (which then negates all the effort of using a copilot), the issue was that there was a type discrepancy between two subqueries ... which the co-pilots still \"can't see\". \n\nRegarding larger code generation, I am skeptical about security. In a post a few months ago I raised the \"A & B & C\" type attack, where the code generated is innocuous if you have 1 or 2 out of the 3 parts, but when combined it is a security breach.

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Starting from scratch each time was quite frustrating, so I've developed a [CSS component scaffolder](https:\/\/github.com\/Liquid-Surf\/css-component-generator). This tool generates new components based on templates, currently including:\n\n- Adding a new API endpoint to CSS (from my work on [FedCM](https:\/\/github.com\/Liquid-Surf\/fedcm-demo)).\n- Adding new login methods to CSS (from my work on [direct SSO auth](https:\/\/github.com\/Liquid-Surf\/css-direct-sso-auth)).\n- A basic \"hello world\" component that logs to the console (based on the default [hello world](https:\/\/github.com\/CommunitySolidServer\/hello-world-component) example).\n\nGoing forward, each time I create a new component, I'll abstract its essential parts and incorporate it as a template. I'm also considering doing this with existing components.\n\nThe CSS learning curve can be steep, so I hope this scaffolder will help newcomers get started more easily. Feel free to suggest new template ideas or point me towards components you'd like to see converted into templates!"},{"event_id":"$Z469pFcEcbeNOEkCsnqUkTdSJf7M5ML6UKQWUOVdKks","sender":"@michielbdejong-54c0fe29db8155e6700ef12e:gitter.im","timestamp":"2025-03-23T16:54:44.610000","body":"Great!"}],"message_count":2,"embed_text":"Announcement

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement.

The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

testing, and updates of the Solid Catalog, specifically focusing on V2. The discussions cover form development, identifier strategies, metadata definition, and catalog updates. While there are slight variations in focus (e.g., identifier strategies vs. landingPage predicate), they are all interconnected within the broader context of the Solid Catalog's development. The mention of 'V3 Planning' in one summary hints at future development but does not deviate significantly enough to warrant a separate cluster.  The content is specific enough that these groups likely belong together."}

testing, and updates of the Solid Catalog, specifically focusing on V2. The discussions cover form development, identifier strategies, metadata definition, and catalog updates. While there are slight variations in focus (e.g., identifier strategies vs. landingPage predicate), they are all interconnected within the broader context of the Solid Catalog's development. The mention of 'V3 Planning' in one summary hints at future development but does not deviate significantly enough to warrant a separate cluster.  The content is specific enough that these groups likely belong together."}

When we were fleshing out this use case, it became clear that the basic Solid pod model could not provide the security requirements for storing health data. Additionally, we at Datasolids are all risk & security practitioners so we take a brutally practical view in how we build things. Solid is the only framework we know of that enables the utility we are aiming for when it comes to patient control of their data, so we made some changes to the architecture to achieve the security profile needed for the use case. Could any backend work for the installation we demoed? Not for health data, or any other flavor of data deemed sensitive, we've found. User control of data is what we're focused on, and the highest measure of control comes from possession, or custody. We want to provide the most secure option available to achieve that, but also to protect what users hold in their pod. We tend to shy away from religious discussions about being failthful to a certain vision of the spec...we're more interested in real world traction.

The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem.

So creating yet another siloed application, which I think is what your abstraction layer would be doing, means that you would be very similar to other siloed approaches without adding in any way to the security you get (maybe diminishing actually) from the Enterprise Solid approach.  An analogy would be pre the web - when there were many \"BBS\" system (I hosted one on a commodore 64) each of those was separate vs. the web where things are interoperable.  You would effectively have a non-interoperable thing that you would have to sell.  With enterprise Solid, not only do you have security beyond the needs of healthcare, but the future-proof insurance that your users can switch to other providers when needed - no proprietary lock-in."},{"event_id":"$emaDwFcJejXazxv1kR9WUIG81Z9LEs6OAw_-JAPCd1o","sender":"@mwhaddle:matrix.org","timestamp":"2025-04-27T06:41:30.710000","body":"Is Enterprise Solid HIPAA compliant?"},{"event_id":"$5-_r1-B3npgOy8YpB99b32b42aEPxTplFmsD_GUoXxo","sender":"@josh-cornejo:matrix.org","timestamp":"2025-04-27T15:27:31.030000","body":"sorry to intervene - HIPAA \/ PCI \/ GDPR are mostly process-focused ...

Catalog: Development, Testing, & Management","llm_coherence_score":9,"llm_topic_label":"Solid Catalog V2 Development and Testing","llm_validation_notes":"All groups clearly relate to the development, testing, and updates of the Solid Catalog, specifically focusing on V2. The discussions cover form development, identifier strategies, metadata definition, and catalog updates. While there are slight variations in focus (e.g., identifier strategies vs. landingPage predicate), they are all interconnected within the broader context of the Solid Catalog's development. The mention of 'V3 Planning' in one summary hints at future development but does not deviate significantly enough to warrant a separate cluster.  The content is specific enough that these groups likely belong together."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

testing, and updates of the Solid Catalog, specifically focusing on V2. The discussions cover form development, identifier strategies, metadata definition, and catalog updates. While there are slight variations in focus (e.g., identifier strategies vs. landingPage predicate), they are all interconnected within the broader context of the Solid Catalog's development. The mention of 'V3 Planning' in one summary hints at future development but does not deviate significantly enough to warrant a separate cluster.  The content is specific enough that these groups likely belong together."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

Adoption & Philosophy","llm_coherence_score":7,"llm_topic_label":"Data Sovereignty, Decentralized Applications, and Adoption Challenges","llm_validation_notes":"The two groups are related through the broader theme of data sovereignty and decentralized application development. Group 1 discusses Anytype, a specific 'everything app' aiming for local-first and decentralized functionality, and contrasts it with a specialized app approach (PodOS). Group 2 addresses the challenges of adoption and perception of maturity for solutions like Solid, which promote data sovereignty. Both groups touch on the challenges of moving away from centralized solutions and adopting decentralized paradigms. While distinct, they are conceptually linked. The coherence score is a 7 because the connection isn't immediately obvious, but becomes clear upon closer examination of the summaries and keywords. They could potentially be broken into smaller groups, but keeping them together highlights the overarching challenge of decentralized data adoption."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

All groups are related to the creation, maintenance, and governance of the Solid Ecosystem Catalog. They specifically discuss using RDF descriptions and SHACL shapes for data representation and validation, as well as the practical aspects of repository structure, versioning, and community collaboration. The progression moves from initial introduction and collaboration on shapes to repository restructuring, updates, and governance. I don't see any reason to split the groups into separate clusters as they all contribute to a unified narrative around the development of a key component of the Solid ecosystem."}

I came in because someone ran into this project https:\/\/solid.github.io\/erp\/, and noticed the resonance with Valueflows, and pinged Pavlik and Michiel de Jong (Ponder Source) in the Valueflows channel.  Pavlik put a *lot* of work into Valueflows in the early years.  Both ERP and Food were important use case inputs to Valueflows.  And a few years ago, we did some data mapping with DFC.

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Building & Logistics","llm_coherence_score":8,"llm_topic_label":"Introduction to Sleepy Bike, Discussions on Solid Practitioner Monetization, and Related Community Governance Issues","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are largely semantically related. The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement. While there are miscellaneous social messages and channel logistics, they don't detract significantly from the overall coherence. The orphaned messages indicate a small degree of potential incoherence, but overall the cluster represents a connected conversation."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Systems","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are mostly related to announcements and discussions surrounding meetings within a community focused on decentralized systems. Topics include search, RDF, digital signatures, localization, transportation, and related technologies like JavaScript tooling and graph security. While there's a slight spread, the core revolves around meeting organization, content, and related technical discussions. The academic paper sharing and the DESERE call for papers fit well within this context, as they're relevant to the community's interests.  Some topics like food scarcity and supply chains are slightly tangential, but the context of a 'Practitioners meeting' and 'Valueflows' ties it back to the broader theme of decentralized applications. A score of 7 reflects the general coherence with a few groups being somewhat loosely related."}

The other thing that was hard is finding good\/current documentation that doesn't 404 frequently. The Inrupt content was a frequent letdown in both regards  https:\/\/github.com\/ewingson\/solid-info was a godsend though to get over the biggest

The initial greetings and introductions lead into the Sleepy Bike project introduction and related questions. The discussions on monetization strategies for Solid Practitioners and background on hospitality exchange communities (like WarmShowers, related to Sleepy Bike's potential context) flow logically. The NGI grant application and organizational affiliation discussions are also relevant, indicating projects being supported and community engagement.

Last week I sent an impassioned recommendation to our senior leadership to read \"This is for Everyone\", and to consider Solid. Today an assortment of people (no senior leadership) had a meeting with a group that is leveraging Snowflake (Dataverse?) as an aggregator for user data from a variety of sources (training, Adobe, events, etc.). The issue I'm running up against is that we've already got auth using Keycloak or IBM Verify, and now this snowflake piece could apparently handle CRUD operations. How do I get people over what seems like the insurmountable hurdle of wanting to give users their data sovereignty when faced with other solutions that, on the surface, appear to achieve the same functionality? I'm not a good salesperson."},{"event_id":"$lMKEb1HgjytiBFl9-AQNqXXqs3AnSmqVuKGdw0Li50U","sender":"@elf-pavlik-53f689c8163965c9bc1ffb15:gitter.im","timestamp":"2025-10-01T02:57:23.459000","body":"Since you mentioned Keycloak, there was an ongoing work for adding Solid-OIDC support: https:\/\/github.com\/CarrettiPro\/keycloak-solid. I used to have it listed in Solid Efforts. I will need to add it back.\nIn general, I would be cautious to always be clear that Solid is still a moving target. Currently, it is based on a set of Solid CG drafts, some providing alternatives to one another, and various work happening outside of the CG, which is also part of the broader Solid Ecosystem. The first cornerstone of solid will be the W3C LWS spec, which will be finalized in the best case a year from now. I would expect that the WG charter may need to be extended, and it may take even longer.    Meanwhile, implementation feedback is fundamental, so if people are in a position to aim for the long run and have the capacity to adjust to inevitable changes, then I would say try to help with making Solid happen. Personally, I see it as an alpha test period, where everyone needs to know that things are still work in progress, and while there is certain extra effort, it's also an opportunity to contribute to the final result in a meaningful way."},{"event_id":"$Z8SM6PqIzP6zDdWZyAB9m_ArY4s0r2UJyX_hGpuckX0","sender":"@jeff-zucker:matrix.org","timestamp":"2025-10-01T03:34:47.771000","body":"> I see it as an alpha test period\n\nI think that statement, while perhaps true when looking solely at the specs, is completely misleading when it comes to user apps.  There are a number of apps which are either in production or are in beta or MVP phase.  It is perfectly feasable to make useful apps in the current state of affairs.  Will those apps need to be revised as the specs come into place, yes proabably.  But that does not meant that they can not perform the functions they were intended  for or be useful to people. This room and group are for people who are building those apps.  Please restrict your nay-saying to the specification channel which is what your critique applies to.  Yes, there are hurdles and things will change but that does not mean that nothing works or that users should be discouraged (as you are attempting to do).  I find it very counter-productive to meet new users with the kind of negativity you are displaying.  That is the way to scare off new users, not how to onboard them."},{"event_id":"$Jwd2CUyksP0c50L-dcEWmqLCkeKUMszFQwMzP0hCw70","sender":"@jeff-zucker:matrix.org","timestamp":"2025-10-01T04:06:26.077000","body":"The question of adoption is really important and is definitely one that other practitioners are facing and that is an ongoing topic of discussion in our meetings.

Personally I feel that is better in a discussion format than a survey.   The question of how Solid handles login and security is an architectural question and therefore much more suited to the CG.  Practitioners tries to be bottom up - we start with a social issue or end-user need and work from there to practical ways those can be solved with Solid or other technologies.  Your top-down  approach - here's a technology\/architecture question, how do we solve it is quite appropriate for the CG but unless one of our member projects is running into issues that they want addressed related to it, our discussions are focused on practice not theory, on things that exist or are being built today and can be used today to accomplish what our members are seeking to accomplish.  The Practitioners is meant to support people building products and services, not to discuss theories of how security should be handled which is much more appropriate for the CG.  If those topics come up in relation to a Practitioner project we'll certainly pass questions and suggestions to the CG, but I personally don't feel it is appropriate for the CG to raise those issues rather letting Practitioners decide for themselves what topics they want to discuss."}],"message_count":7,"embed_text":"Adoption and Maturity Debate: Lukedary sought advice on selling Solid's data

Adoption & Philosophy","llm_coherence_score":7,"llm_topic_label":"Data Sovereignty, Decentralized Applications, and Adoption Challenges","llm_validation_notes":"The two groups are related through the broader theme of data sovereignty and decentralized application development. Group 1 discusses Anytype, a specific 'everything app' aiming for local-first and decentralized functionality, and contrasts it with a specialized app approach (PodOS). Group 2 addresses the challenges of adoption and perception of maturity for solutions like Solid, which promote data sovereignty. Both groups touch on the challenges of moving away from centralized solutions and adopting decentralized paradigms. While distinct, they are conceptually linked. The coherence score is a 7 because the connection isn't immediately obvious, but becomes clear upon closer examination of the summaries and keywords. They could potentially be broken into smaller groups, but keeping them together highlights the overarching challenge of decentralized data adoption."}

It is a tool for architecture diagrams, especially architecture as code. Some of you may remember videos I made for TPAC a while ago https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLXBho\\_YohPB3SreXojlJLa9MaprXRDhdR\nIt was done with prioprietary web app called IcePanel. Now I tried an open source alternative which is also amazing! https:\/\/likec4.dev\/\nThey have playground but _share_ link doesn't work for me, if you want to see early draft of architecture for my next generation setup of Solid (it will take some time to write missing code and fully deploy it), you can just paste this snippet in the Like4C playground\n\n```\nspecification {\n  element system\n

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Applications: Development & Troubleshooting","llm_coherence_score":9,"llm_topic_label":"Solid Ecosystem Development and Application","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are strongly semantically related, focusing on various aspects of building and utilizing the Solid ecosystem. They cover topics like: AI agent development on Solid data, user profile management and access control, schema definition, project announcements, seeking resources, and integrating Solid into existing systems. The core theme revolves around development, application, and community support within the Solid ecosystem. While there are specific sub-themes (e.g., user experience, schema design), they all contribute to the overall coherence of the cluster. No groups appear to require splitting as they all relate to the general topic."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}

Practitioners Group: Meeting logistics, scope definition, and onboarding strategies.","llm_validation_notes":"The groups are highly semantically related. They all center around the activities, organization, and scope of the 'Solid Practitioners' group. Topics include scheduling meetings, defining the group's focus, addressing administrative issues (access rights, URL standardization), sharing meeting notes, and outlining onboarding strategies. While there are many aspects to this group, they are all connected and contribute to the overall operation and purpose of the Solid Practitioners group. Splitting the cluster seems unnecessary as the apparent diversity is well unified under the main working group. The group's relation to the W3C is also discussed, which is further testament to the coherence."}
