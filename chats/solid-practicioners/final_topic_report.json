Initially, conversations focused intensely on logistical stabilization, including defining and adhering to a regular bi-weekly meeting cadence, resolving conflicts in time zone and scheduling, standardizing external communication channels (Matrix space, mailing lists), and ensuring reliable access to documentation (agendas, notes, and meeting recordings). As the group matured, the focus shifted toward active technical project coordination—leading dedicated sessions on topics like Solid Web Components, Indexing, and Real Time Solid (RTS)—and defining strategic resources (onboarding content, research catalog). The most significant evolution involved the formalization of the group's structure and its external role. This transition included publishing a formal scope, actively participating in ODI Solid governance discussions, securing a crucial seat on the ODI Solid Advisory Committee (OAC), and successfully establishing internal governance through the drafting of a charter and the election of co-chairs and external representatives. Overall, the discussions reflect the effort to transform a collection of active developers into a highly organized, recognized, and influential body within the Solid ecosystem.",

The overall focus highlights the ongoing architectural and regulatory struggle to achieve both decentralization and high-level medical data compliance.",
