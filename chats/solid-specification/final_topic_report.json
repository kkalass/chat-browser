    "meta_summary": "The analysis of conversations reveals the Solid Community Group (CG) has been intensely focused on stabilizing and expanding the foundational Solid Protocol, preparing it for formal W3C Working Group status (Linked Web Storage WG). Core protocol mechanics were heavily scrutinized, including content negotiation defaults, HTTP status code usage (PUT/POST/PATCH), resource discovery (Link headers, pim:storage), and complex semantics surrounding resource representation, URI persistence, and container management. A clear evolution is visible in authorization, moving beyond the recognized flaws of Web Access Control (WAC) toward more scalable, policy-based systems like Access Control Policy (ACP) and Authorization Agents (SAI), alongside continuous debates regarding the necessity of triple-level permissions and robust delegation models (VCs, HttpSig). Authentication standards solidified around Solid-OIDC, with significant effort dedicated to PKCE workflows, token binding (DPoP), and improving the WebID Profile structure for reliability and security. Finally, the community transitioned its focus from core plumbing to enabling sophisticated application interoperability (C2C), spawning specialized efforts in Notifications (Solid-PREP), search mechanisms, and standardized data models (Type Indexes, Contacts, ERP), reflecting a shift toward building a robust, developer-friendly ecosystem.",
