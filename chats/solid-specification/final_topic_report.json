Discussions are highly technical, focusing heavily on establishing clear HTTP semantics, including resource type determination (RDF vs. Container), handling of PUT/PATCH requests (especially regarding containment triples and status codes), and the foundational importance of Content-Type headers. Procedurally, the community is focused on improving specification quality by using formal processes (like ADRs), defining conformance classes, and ensuring traceability between requirements and test suites. Over time, the focus has shifted from initial debates (e.g., LDP dependency, N3 Patch vs. SPARQL Update) to publishing mature Technical Reports (e.g., v0.9.0, 2022 TRs), standardizing terminology (\"Storage\" over \"Data Pod\"), and establishing persistent, reliable URI links for official documents, reflecting a determined effort to move the Solid Protocol toward a stable and widely implemented standard.",

Discussions moved from implementing and refining foundational specifications, primarily Web Access Control (WAC) and Solid-OIDC, to addressing their inherent complexities and limitations. Key areas of focus included hardening Solid-OIDC security (adopting RFC 9207, maintaining PKCE), clarifying the dual nature and required structure of WebIDs (distinguishing between the technical WebID document and the social Solid Profile document), and establishing robust methods for group authorization and non-browser client identification (bots). The ongoing debate signals a clear architectural shift away from pure WAC—due to recognized flaws in inheritance and unreliable client identification via `acl:origin`—towards more modern, capability-aware, and fine-grained authorization frameworks like Access Control Policy (ACP) and the proposed Solid Authorization Interoperability (SAI) architecture. This evolution emphasizes solving delegation issues, improving data discovery security (Type Indexes), and preventing configuration issues like user lockout from Pods.",

The consensus emphasized the need for a universally reliable mechanism to define and locate the 'Storage' space, critical for application usability. Simultaneously, extensive discussions addressed the scalability limitations of using standard RDF/SPARQL for large-scale data querying and free-text search. The community strongly debated the necessity of dedicated, standardized server-side Search APIs (often proposing solutions inspired by Apache Solr) as alternatives to client-side indexing strategies or relying solely on SPARQL.

A primary focus was the complex definition of Solid Containers, including clarifying lifecycle management, standardizing rich metadata (comparing ontologies like POSIX stat and Dublin Core), and addressing scalability challenges related to authorization and resource representation. Discussions highlighted the immense value and vulnerability of user data, leading to calls for comprehensive backup strategies and standards for Pod provider trust. A major technical theme involved ensuring URI persistence and data integrity when resources are moved, exemplified by solutions like TrinPod's permanent URI strategy and the PDS Interop specification for link metadata. Furthermore, efficiency improvements were prioritized through developing specifications for bulk data operations—including upload via compressed archives and defining a standard Pod export format (N-Quads). Underlying these efforts were deep technical debates on utilizing core HTTP mechanisms, such as advanced content negotiation (to resolve caching ambiguities), appropriate use of HTTP status codes (like 300 and 303) for resource identification, and techniques for informing clients about alternative resource representations. Collectively, these conversations demonstrate an evolution from foundational definitions toward addressing the complexities required for resilient, large-scale decentralized data management.",

Key challenges addressed include fundamental flaws in the existing WebSocket specification, necessitating a complete re-design to incorporate authorization, and reconciling Solid's access control model (ACL) with inherent browser security limitations, particularly concerning serving JavaScript-embedded HTML from Pods. Authentication is evolving through proposals for enhanced security (2FA via IP/Agent tracking) and persistent focus on improving the user login experience, including exploring integration with modern standards like FedCM and Passkeys, despite current development pauses. Crucially, End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) has emerged as a high-priority technical area, driving discussions on complex implementation issues such as key rotation, authorization mapping for encrypted data, and the general need for a formalized, secure application trust model extending beyond the browser.
